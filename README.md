<p align="center">Recently, I have started to immerse myself in the powerful C programming language 💡. Despite being relatively new to this language, I have already managed to make significant contributions. C, with its efficiency and flexibility, has allowed me to work on low-level projects and better understand how computers work at the hardware level 🖥️.</p>

<p align="center">In addition, I have intermediate proficiency in JavaScript 🌐 an essential language for web development. My JavaScript projects on GitHub demonstrate my ability to create interactive and dynamic web applications. From DOM manipulation to state management in single-page applications, each repository is a testament to my eagerness to continue learning JavaScript.</p>

<p align="center">All this combined with the use of Bash 🐚. Bash, the Unix command interpreter, is a powerful tool for task automation and system administration. My Bash scripts on GitHub showcase my ability to write efficient and robust scripts that can automate complex and repetitive tasks.</p>

<p align="center">So what are you waiting for, dive into the exciting world of my GitHub and discover the wonders of technology today! 🎉</p>
